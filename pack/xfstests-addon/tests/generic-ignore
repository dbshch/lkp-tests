## The "generic" testcase will use the different filesystem to test which will generate the different running result.
## For example:
## generic/114 with ext4 filesystem can pass the function checking.
## generic/114 with xfs  filesystem can't pass the function checking.
##
## Due to "generic" testcase have the different result with the different filesystem, we just filter the subcase which can't pass any filesystem.
